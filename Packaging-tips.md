# Packaging tips

This wiki page can be used to gather issues and tips that pertain to
building PL/Java packages for downstream distributions or repositories,
in between updates to the [packaging section][docs] in the versioned
documentation.

Anyone producing a prebuilt PL/Java package is encouraged to announce
its availability on the [[Prebuilt packages]] wiki page.
